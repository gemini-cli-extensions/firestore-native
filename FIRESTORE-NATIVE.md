# Setup

## Required Gemini CLI Version

To install this extension, the Gemini CLI version must be v0.6.0 or above. The version can be found by running: `gemini --version`.

## Firestore MCP Server (Data Plane: Connecting and Querying)

This section covers connecting to a Firestore instance.

1.  **Verify Environment Variables**: Before attempting to connect, confirm with the user that the following environment variables are set in the extension configuration or their shell environment.

    *   `FIRESTORE_PROJECT`: The GCP project ID.
    *   `FIRESTORE_DATABASE`: The Firestore database ID.

2.  **Handle Missing Variables**: If a command fails with an error message containing a placeholder like `${FIRESTORE_PROJECT}`, it signifies a missing environment variable. Inform the user which variable is missing and instruct them to set it.

3.  **Handle Permission Errors**: If you encounter permission errors, ensure the user has the correct Firestore permissions (e.g., `datastore.entities.list`, `datastore.entities.create`). The user likely lacks the roles Cloud Datastore User (`roles/datastore.user`) and Firebase Rules Viewer (`roles/firebaserules.viewer`). You can provide these links for assistance:
   * Granting Roles: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/grant-role-console
   * Firestore Permissions: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/firestore

# Usage Guidelines

## Connecting to New Resources

You will need to perform the following steps to change the current database connection:

1.  **(Optional) Save your conversation:** To avoid losing your progress, save the current session by running the command: `/chat save <your-tag>`
2.  **Stop the CLI:** Terminate the Gemini CLI.
3.  **Update Environment Variables:** Set or update your environment variables (e.g. `FIRESTORE_DATABASE`) to point to the new resource.
4.  **Restart:** Relaunch the Gemini CLI
5.  **(Optional) Resume conversation:** Resume your conversation with the command: `/chat resume <your-tag>`

## Reusing Project Values

Users may have set project environment variables:

*   `FIRESTORE_PROJECT`: The GCP project ID.
*   `FIRESTORE_DATABASE`: The Firestore database ID.

Instead of prompting the user for these values for specific tool calls, prompt the user to verify reuse a specific value.
Make sure to not use the environment variable name like `FIRESTORE_PROJECT`, `${FIRESTORE_PROJECT}`, or `$FIRESTORE_PROJECT`. The value can be found by using command: `echo $FIRESTORE_PROJECT`.
